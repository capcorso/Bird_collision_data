An Exploration of Avian Conservation Center Collision Data 

The Avian Conservation Center & Center For Birds of Prey located in Awendaw, 
SC accepts injured birds brought in by the public. When a raptor or bird is 
brought to the clinic the center collects data on factors including their species, 
cause of injury and whether the bird survived after treatment or succumbed to 
its injuries. The objective of this project was to use recorded collision data 
in R Scipt programing to examine the relationship between species, frequency and 
mortaily rates of bird strikes. With the goal of being able to target conservation 
efforts by identifying the most vulnerable species. 
    
The study used two different data sets that contained bird collision data. The 
first data set titled 'Old.ACC.dat.csv' in this repository contained collision 
data from 1992 through 2017. This data was obtained by a previous students repository, 
Casey Conrad's 2018 Analysis of Avian Conservation Center bird strikes project. 
Which can be found here: https://github.com/conradcd/ACC_Bird_Strikes. The second 
data set titled 'new.data.csv.numbers', contained collision data of 2017 through 
2023, this was obtained by contacting the current ACC Avian Clinic Manager,  Jessie Griswold at: jessie.griswold@avianconservationcenter.org . 

The specific data explored in this alaysis was the species names, their frequency of 
collisions with mortality and survival rates after collision. The two data sets were 
explored seperately and together by binding the data frames. To recreate my figures 
found in the 'Figures' folder run the 'ACC_Data_Exploration' scipt using the 
two sets of data found in 'data' folder of this repository named 
'new.data.csv (1).csv' and 'Old.ACC.dat.csv'. 
    
I would like to thank and acknowledge Dr. Dan McGlinn for his guidance and support 
throughout this project. In addition to Jessie Griswold and Casey Conrad for thier 
assistance in obtaining the avian collision data explored.
