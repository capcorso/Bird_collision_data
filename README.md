The objective of this project was to examine two sets of bird collision data collected by the Avian Conservation Center (ACC). The first set of data was collected from 1992 to 2017 and the second set of colision data was collected from 2019-2023. The Avian Concervation Center collected data on birds that had collsisions with either building windows or cars and were called into the center or brought in for treatment. The Center kept record of the species of bird, the otucome as to weather the bird was released 
The research aimed at examining the different collision rates between species, in addition to looking at which species had higher rates of mortality when collision incidents occured.
